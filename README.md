## üåæDeployment and Usage
### Deploying the API endpoints (backend)
- Backend is developed using FastAPI (python)
- Go to the backend folder 
```bash
  cd backend
```
- Install all the requirments
```bash
  pip install -r requirments.txt
```
- Run the server (default port: http://127.0.0.1:8000)
```bash
  uvicorn main:app
```
- Already hosted server could be found on 
```bash
  https://farmconnectback.onrender.com/docs
```
- When hosting on server, you can use the Dockerfile provided to containerize the program to avoid any dependency issues.

### Generating and Testing APK (frontend)
- Frontend is developed on Android studios
- Change the endpoint URL to your own backend URL.
- Use 10.0.2.2:8000 to access the localhost.
- Generate the .apk file from the Android Studios


## üêÑAPI Documentation
- The project provides API endpoints for the developers to implement them in their own projects, extensions or apps.
- API Documentation is simple and is available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
